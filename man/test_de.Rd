\title{Hypothesis test of direct effect with mediated stochastic interventions
using the multiplier bootstrap}
\usage{
test_de(W, A, Z, Y, delta_grid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.2),
  mult_type = c("rademacher", "gaussian"), ci_level = 0.95,
  n_mult = 10000, cv_folds = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A \code{matrix}, \code{data.frame}, or similar corresponding to a
set of baseline covariates.}

\item{A}{A \code{numeric} vector corresponding to a treatment variable. The
parameter of interest is defined as a location shift of this quantity.}

\item{Z}{A \code{numeric} vector, \code{matrix}, \code{data.frame}, or
similar corresponding to a set of mediators (on the causal pathway between
the intervention A and the outcome Y).}

\item{Y}{A \code{numeric} vector corresponding to an outcome variable.}

\item{delta_grid}{A \code{numeric} of values giving the varous degrees of
shift in the intervention to be used in defining the causal quantity of
interest. In the case of binary interventions, this takes the form of an
incremental propensity score shift, acting as a multiplier of probabilities
with which a given observational unit receives the intervention (EH Kennedy,
2018, JASA; <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1422737>).}

\item{mult_type}{A \code{character} identifying the type of multipliers to be
used in the multiplier bootstrap. Choices are limited to \code{"rademacher"}
or \code{"gaussian"}, with the default being the former.}

\item{ci_level}{A \code{numeric} indicating the (1 - alpha) level of the
simultaneous confidence band to be computed around the estimates of the
direct effect. The error level of the test reported in the p-value returned
is simply alpha, i.e., one less this quantity.}

\item{n_mult}{A \code{numeric} scalar giving the number of repetitions of the
multipliers to be used in computing the multiplier bootstrap.}

\item{cv_folds}{A \code{numeric} integer value specifying the number of folds
to be created for cross-validation. Use of cross-validation / cross-fitting
allows for entropy conditions on the AIPW estimator to be relaxed. Note: for
compatibility with \code{origami::make_folds}, this value specified here
must be greater than or equal to 2; the default is to create 10 folds.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{medshift}}.}
