> Causal Mediation Analysis for Stochastic Interventions

**Authors:** [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org) and [Iván

## What’s `medshift`?

The `medshift` R package is designed to provide facilities for
estimating direct and indirect effects of stochastic interventions in
settings in which causal mediation analysis is of interest. `medshift`
is designed as an implementation to accompany the methods described in
“Causal mediation analysis for stochastic interventions” (Díaz and
Hejazi, n.d.).
