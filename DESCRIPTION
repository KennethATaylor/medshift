Description: Estimators of a parameter arising in the decomposition of the
    population intervention (in)direct effect of stochastic interventions in
    causal mediation analysis, including efficient one-step, targeted minimum
    loss (TML), re-weighting (IPW), and substitution estimators. The parameter
    estimated constitutes a part of each of the population intervention
    (in)direct effects. These estimators may be used in assessing population
    intervention (in)direct effects under stochastic treatment regimes,
    including incremental propensity score interventions and modified treatment
    policies. The methodology was first discussed by I Díaz and NS Hejazi
    (2020) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12362>.
