## What's `medshift`?

The `medshift` R package is designed to provide facilities to...

---

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/medshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `medshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(medshift)
library(condensier)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_medshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                           g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             nbins = 25,
                                             bin_method = "dhist",
                                             bin_estimator =
                                               speedglmR6$new(),
                                             parfit = FALSE),
                           Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          )

# conveniently summarize the results
summary(tmle_shift)
```
